## Conversation Techniques

### Building Context

The AI remembers your conversation:

```
You: "Tell me about token ABC"
AI: [Provides detailed analysis]

You: "What about its competitor?"
AI: [Understands context, discusses competitor]

You: "Which one is safer?"
AI: [Compares both tokens from earlier]
```

**Context Scope**

- Remembers entire session
- References previous tokens
- Builds on earlier explanations
- Resets when you refresh the page

### Follow-Up Questions

Dig deeper without repeating:

```
You: "Analyze [contract address]"
AI: [Provides analysis with MEDIUM risk score]

You: "Why is it medium risk?"
AI: [Explains specific risk factors]

You: "How can I reduce that risk?"
AI: [Suggests what to look for/avoid]
```

### Asking Multiple Questions

**Sequential Approach**

```
What's the current price of [token]?
[Wait for response]
What about its liquidity?
[Wait for response]
```

**Batch Approach** (Better!)

```
For [token], tell me:
1. Current price
2. Liquidity status
3. Risk assessment
4. Holder distribution
```

The batch approach is more efficient and gives you a comprehensive answer at once.

### Comparative Queries

Compare multiple tokens:

```
Compare these tokens and tell me which is safer:
Token A: [address 1]
Token B: [address 2]
Token C: [address 3]
```

The AI will analyze all and provide side-by-side comparison.

## Query Types

### General Education

Learn about crypto concepts:

- "Explain what a bonding curve is"
- "How does liquidity locking work?"
- "What makes a token a honeypot?"
- "Define market cap vs FDV"

Perfect for building knowledge!

### Token-Specific Analysis

Deep dive into specific tokens:

- "Full analysis of [contract address]"
- "Risk assessment for [token name]"
- "Holder distribution for [address]"
- "Is [token] safe to buy?"

Provide addresses for best results.

### Market Intelligence

Current market information:

- "What's hot on Pump.fun today?"
- "Show me tokens under 1M market cap"
- "Recent Solana token launches"
- "Current memecoin trends"

The AI searches the web for latest data.

### Risk Evaluation

Security-focused questions:

- "Check if [address] is a rugpull"
- "Contract security review: [address]"
- "What are the red flags for [token]?"
- "Is the liquidity locked?"

Critical before investing!

### Historical Queries

Past performance and trends:

- "How did [token] perform last week?"
- "Price history of [address]"
- "Has [token] recovered from the dip?"
- "Historical holder growth"

Useful for pattern recognition.

## Formatting Your Questions

### Be Specific

**Vague** ❌

```
Tell me about tokens
```

**Specific** ✅

```
Analyze the security risks of [contract address]
and tell me if the liquidity is locked
```

### Include Context

**Minimal Context** ❌

```
Is it good?
```

**Rich Context** ✅

```
I'm looking at [token] for a short-term trade.
Is the current risk level acceptable for a 2-3 day hold?
```

### Structure Complex Requests

**Unstructured** ❌

```
Tell me everything about this token and compare it to similar ones
and check if it's safe and what the price might do
```

**Structured** ✅

```
For [contract address]:
1. Current risk level
2. Top 3 concerns
3. Comparison to similar tokens
4. Short-term outlook
```

### Use Natural Language

You don't need commands or special syntax:

**Robotic** (Works but unnecessary)

```
ANALYZE TOKEN: [address]
PARAMETERS: risk, liquidity, holders
OUTPUT: detailed
```

**Natural** (Preferred)

```
Can you check out this token and let me know
if it's safe? Especially concerned about liquidity.
[address]
```

## Understanding Responses

### Reading AI Answers

**Executive Summary**

- Usually at the top
- One-line verdict
- Risk score
- Key finding

**Detailed Analysis**

- Organized by sections
- Metrics with explanations
- Visual indicators (🟢🟡🔴)
- Source citations

**Recommendations**

- Action items

### Markdown Formatting

The AI uses rich formatting:

**Headers** organize sections

```markdown
## Risk Assessment

### Red Flags
```

**Lists** for readability

- Bullet points for features
- Numbered lists for steps

**Emphasis**

- **Bold** = important info
- _Italic_ = emphasis
- `Code` = addresses/technical

**Tables** for data
| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Risk | Medium | 🟡 |

**Links**
[DexScreener](url) - clickable sources

### Visual Indicators

Quick status understanding:

**Risk Levels**

- 🟢 LOW - Relatively safe
- 🟡 MEDIUM - Proceed with caution
- 🔴 HIGH - Significant risks

**Status Flags**

- ✅ Positive indicator
- ⚠️ Warning sign
- 🚩 Critical red flag
- ❌ Negative finding

**Trends**

- 📈 Increasing/Growing
- 📉 Decreasing/Declining
- ➡️ Stable/Unchanged

## Rate Limiting

### The 50-Second Cooldown

After sending a message:

1. Countdown timer appears
2. Input fields are disabled
3. Send button shows remaining time
4. Must wait before next message

**Why?**

- Ensures fair access for all users
- Prevents system overload
- Maintains response quality
- Protects against abuse

### Working Within Limits

Maximize each query:

**Plan Ahead**

- Think through your question before sending
- Include all relevant details
- Ask compound questions
- Use the waiting time to read responses

**Batch Questions**

```
Instead of 3 separate messages, ask:
"For [token]: check risk, analyze holders, and
compare liquidity to similar tokens"
```

**Read Thoroughly**

- Responses are comprehensive
- AI anticipates follow-ups
- Info you need might already be there

### Cooldown Persistence

The cooldown:

- ✅ Tracks in browser storage
- ✅ Persists across refreshes
- ✅ Works in multiple tabs
- ❌ Cannot be bypassed

This is intentional - wait it out!

## Advanced Techniques

### Conditional Questions

```
If [token A] has locked liquidity, compare it to [token B].
Otherwise, just give me a risk assessment.
```

The AI handles conditional logic.

### Scenario Planning

```
What would happen if the top holder of [token] sold
half their position?
```

Explore hypotheticals.

### Historical Comparison

```
Compare [token]'s current metrics to where it was
3 days ago. Has risk increased or decreased?
```

Track changes over time.

### Multi-Dimensional Analysis

```
Analyze [token] from three perspectives:
1. Day trader (24-48h hold)
2. Swing trader (1-2 week hold)
3. Long-term holder (1+ month)
```

Get perspective-specific insights.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Vague Questions

❌ "What do you think?"
✅ "What's your risk assessment of [contract address]?"

### Mistake #2: Missing Addresses

❌ "Check if CoolCoin is safe"
✅ "Check if [contract address] is safe"

### Mistake #3: Rapid-Fire Questions

❌ Sending 5 questions in separate messages
✅ Combining into one comprehensive question

### Mistake #4: Ignoring Context

❌ Starting fresh each time
✅ Building on previous conversation

### Mistake #5: Not Reading Full Responses

❌ Skimming and asking what was already answered
✅ Reading thoroughly before follow-ups

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Provide Contract Addresses**: More accurate analysis
2. **Be Specific**: Better questions = better answers
3. **Build Context**: Use conversation history
4. **Read Completely**: Responses are comprehensive
5. **Ask Follow-Ups**: Dig deeper into interesting points
6. **Batch Questions**: Combine related queries
7. **Include Time Frames**: "Last 24 hours", "past week", etc.
8. **Specify Preferences**: Short-term vs long-term, risk tolerance
9. **Request Comparisons**: "Compare to [similar token]"
10. **Verify Findings**: Cross-check important information

## Troubleshooting

### AI Not Responding

- Wait 30 seconds (processing may take time)
- Check internet connection
- Refresh page if stuck >1 minute
- Try simpler query

### Incomplete Responses

- Ask "Can you provide more details on [aspect]?"
- Request specific section: "Expand on the risk assessment"
- Rephrase question for clarity

### Unclear Answers

- "Can you explain that more simply?"
- "What does [term] mean?"
- "Give me an example"

### Wrong Token

- Double-check contract address
- Verify correct blockchain
- Try token name + contract address

## Privacy & Security

### Your Conversations

- Not stored on servers
- Not logged or tracked
- Completely anonymous
- Refresh to clear history

### Safe Practices

- Never share private keys
- Don't reveal wallet balances
