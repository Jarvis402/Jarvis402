# Analyzing Tokens

Learn how to get the most out of Jarvis402's token analysis capabilities.

## Overview

Jarvis402 can analyze any cryptocurrency token and provide comprehensive insights including price, market cap, risk assessment, holder distribution, and more.

## Basic Token Analysis

### Method 1: Using Contract Address

The most accurate method for token analysis is to provide the contract address.

**Step 1**: Copy the token's contract address from:
- DexScreener
- CoinGecko
- Blockchain explorer (Etherscan, Solscan, etc.)

**Step 2**: Paste in the "Token Contract Address" field

**Step 3**: Ask your question in the main input field:
```
Analyze this token for me
```

**Example**:
```
Contract Address: So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112
Question: What are the risks with this token?
```

### Method 2: Using Token Name

You can also ask about tokens by name:

```
Tell me about PEPE token
Analyze BONK on Solana
What's the current price of WIF?
```

**Note**: Names can be ambiguous. For accurate analysis, always use contract addresses when possible.
