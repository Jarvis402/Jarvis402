# Web Search Integration

Jarvis402's web search integration is what makes it truly powerful - combining AI intelligence with real-time information from across the internet. This feature ensures you get the latest, most relevant data for your cryptocurrency analysis.

## Overview

The web search capability allows Jarvis402 to:
- **Access Real-Time Data**: Get current market information, not just training data

## How Web Search Works

### Automatic Search Triggers

The AI automatically performs web searches when:

**Token-Specific Queries**
- You provide a contract address
- You ask about specific token names
- You request current price information
- You want latest developments

**Market Information**
- "What are trending tokens today?"
- "Show me recent Pump.fun launches"
- "What's the current Solana gas fee?"
- "Are memecoins pumping right now?"

**News and Events**
- "Any recent news about [token]?"
- "What happened with [project]?"
- "Latest developments in DeFi"
- "Recent crypto regulations"

### Search Process

## Performance Optimization

### Speed Factors

Search speed depends on:

**Query Complexity**
- Simple price check: 2-5 seconds
- Multi-token comparison: 5-10 seconds
- Comprehensive analysis: 10-20 seconds
- Deep research: 20-30 seconds

**Data Availability**
- Popular tokens: Faster (more sources)
- Obscure tokens: Slower (fewer sources)
- Recent events: Faster (cached)
- Historical data: May take longer

**System Load**
- Low traffic: Faster responses
- High traffic: May queue briefly
- Rate limits: Built into timing

### Optimizing Your Experience

**Batch Queries**
```
Instead of:
"Price of token A?"
then "Price of token B?"
then "Price of token C?"

Ask:
"Current prices for tokens A, B, and C?"
```

**Be Patient**
- Complex searches take time
- Quality > speed
- Thorough analysis requires processing

**Use Cached Data When Appropriate**
- Recent queries may use cached results
- Reduces search time
- Still provides accurate information

## Troubleshooting

### Slow Search Results

If searches are taking too long:
1. Simplify your query
2. Remove ambiguous terms
3. Be more specific with identifiers
4. Try again during lower traffic times

### No Results Found

If the AI can't find information:
1. Check contract address is correct
2. Verify token exists and is tradeable
3. Try alternative search terms
4. Token may be too new or obscure

### Conflicting Information

If sources disagree:
1. AI will note discrepancies
2. Multiple perspectives provided
3. Most reliable source highlighted
4. You can request clarification

### Outdated Information

If data seems old:
1. Ask explicitly for "latest" or "current"
2. Specify a time frame
3. Request refresh of data
4. Check source timestamps

## Best Practices

1. **Verify Critical Information**: Cross-check important findings
2. **Note Timestamps**: Pay attention to data freshness
3. **Consider Source Bias**: Some sources may be promotional
4. **Request Multiple Sources**: "Check multiple sources for [query]"
5. **Stay Current**: Markets move fast, requery often
6. **Combine with Analysis**: Use search with token analysis for complete picture
