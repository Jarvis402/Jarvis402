## Overview

**Jarvis402** is an autonomous AI agent that handles payments on your behalf using the x402 protocol. It enables you to access paid APIs, services, and digital resources without manual intervention‚Äîjust tell Jarvis what you need, and it handles the payment automatically.

### Key Features

- ü§ñ **Autonomous Payments** - AI agent automatically processes HTTP 402 payment flows
- ‚ö° **Instant Settlement** - Payments settle in ~2 seconds at blockchain speed
- üí∞ **Zero Platform Fees** - No middlemen, only blockchain gas and service costs
- üåê **Blockchain Agnostic** - Works with Ethereum, Solana, and any x402-compatible chain
- üîí **No Registration** - Access services without accounts, emails, or OAuth
- üõ°Ô∏è **Spending Limits** - Set daily, weekly, and monthly spending caps for safety
- üìä **Open Protocol** - Built on the open x402 standard for internet-native payments
- üß† **AI-Powered** - Natural language interface powered by Google Gemini

## What is x402?

x402 is an open protocol for internet-native payments built around the **HTTP 402 Payment Required** status code. It enables:

- **Programmatic payments** without accounts or sessions
- **Direct blockchain transactions** for instant service access
- **Zero-fee transactions** with no intermediaries
- **Machine-to-machine commerce** at internet scale

## How Jarvis402 Works

### The Payment Flow

1. **You Make a Request**
   - Tell Jarvis402 in natural language what service you need
   - Example: "Get me the latest weather data from WeatherAPI"

2. **Jarvis Detects Payment Required**
   - Service returns HTTP 402 (Payment Required)
   - Jarvis reads the x402 payment details from the response

3. **Autonomous Payment Processing**
   - Jarvis checks your spending limits
   - Submits blockchain transaction automatically
   - Waits for payment confirmation (~2 seconds)

4. **Instant Access**
   - Retries the original request with payment proof
   - Receives and presents the data to you
   - All within seconds, zero manual intervention
