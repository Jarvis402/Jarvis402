## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0

The project focus has shifted from token analysis to autonomous payments:

**Before:**
```javascript
// Token analysis focus
"Analyze this token: 0x..."
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Payment processing focus
"Pay for weather API access"
```

No code changes required for end users, but conceptual understanding of the platform has shifted.
